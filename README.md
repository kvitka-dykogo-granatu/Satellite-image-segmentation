This project analyzes and compares various machine learning methods for
segmenting buildings in satellite imagery. It focuses particularly on clustering
algorithms such as K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, and morphACWE for solving the
unsupervised learning problem, as well as deep neural networks utilizing
architectures like U-Net, U-Net++, and FPN. The application of these methods to
detailed satellite images and their effectiveness in addressing the task of semantic
segmentation are examined. The efficiency of the improved U-Net model is
investigated and a modified U-Net++ architecture is proposed.
The software section of the research was written in the Python programming
language in the Jupyter development environment. The libraries Numpy, Pandas,
Matplotlib, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Scikit-Fuzzy and Scikit-Image were used in the
implementation. The PyTorch, Torchvision, and Albumentations libraries were used
to train and evaluate neural network models.
